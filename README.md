# Introduction
In this paper, we collect and label a new age dataset called Real Scenario Face Age Dataset (RSFAD), which includes 85,044 facial images captured from surveillance cameras in the wild. Each images in RSFAD dataset has been labeled facial bounding-box (BBox), age group, gender and breathing mask. The age label ranges from 0-70 years and divided into 14 age groups: 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 16-20, 20-25, 25-30, 30-35, 30-40, 40-45, 45-50, 50-55, 55-60, 60-65, 65-70. We labeled each face to corresponding age group based on its apparent age was closed to the median of age group. The statistics of the RSFAD dataset are shown in Table II. The dataset contains 85,044 face images which divided into 14 age groups, each group is comprised of four subgroups: female not wearing breathing-mask, female wearing breathing-mask, male not wearing breathing-mask, male wearing breathing-mask, and the number of face images in each sub-group are nearly 1,500.
